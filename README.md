# BAND Website

Its a webpage for the fictional band "SONS-OF-THE-HORSES-I-KILLED" which me and my friends are "in". This webpage is meant to introduce new listeners to a few samples of the band's songs, advertise their other social platforms and provide some context into the band's creation.

## Design Process

The webpage is targetted towards listeners of rock and roll music and hence, includes alot of red and dark colors in general.

## Features

There are hyperlinks which enable the user to jump to whichever section of content they want to view on the webpage. The hyperlinks can be found in the nav menus in the header and footer of the page.

In addition, there ae hyperlinks that link to other websites/webpages, that create a new tab for users to view the other content.

There are certain text-boxes and images also expand when the user hovers over them.

There is a music sample section to one of the band's "albums" which has audio control functions, allowing the user to listen to the songs.


### Features Left to Implement
- Media Query is not functional.
